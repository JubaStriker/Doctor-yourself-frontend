                    bloating along with digestion issues, I had hair fall and acne problem
                    which gave me stress and anxiety and frequently used to suffer from
                    fever So in January 3rd week of this I started taking treatment from
                    Deepta. After Starting the treatment, I slowly started recovering from
                    digestive issues that too without medicines from past few years I was
                    under ayurvedic medicines for digestion. It was very difficult for me to
                    live without medicines with the help of Deepta from guidance Kd
